### 1. 피봇/언피봇 PIVOT/UNPIVOT
```SQL
WITH t AS
(
SELECT CHR(LEVEL + 64) c
     , LEVEL v
  FROM dual
CONNECT BY LEVEL <= 26
)
SELECT *
    FROM(SELECT *
            FROM(SELECT C, TO_CHAR(V) V, CEIL(V/7) GB1, MOD(V-1,7)+1 GB3
                    FROM T
            ) UNPIVOT(V FOR GB2 IN (C AS 1, V AS 2))
    )PIVOT(MIN(V) FOR GB3 IN (1 V1, 2 V2, 3 V3, 4 V4, 5 V5,6 V6, 7 V7))
ORDER BY 1,2
;
```



### 2. 계층
```SQL
SELECT
    LEVEL,
    PRIOR COLNAME,
    SYS_CONNCECT_BY_PATH(COLNAME,'SEP')
  FROM T
 START WITH COL IS NULL
 CONNECT BY PRIOR SON=MOM;
 
 
SELECT SUBSTR(SYS_CONNECT_BY_PATH(CODE,'-'),2) CODE
    FROM TEST
  CONNECT BY NOCYCLE PRIOR CODE != CODE
  ORDER BY LEVEL, CODE;
```


### 3. TRANSLATE
```SQL
SELECT
    TRANSLATE(
    '바꿀대상',
    '대상문자',
    '바꿀문자'
    )
    FROM T
```

### 4. LEFT OUTER JOIN PARTITION BY
```SQL
SELECT 집계()
    FROM T1
  LEFT OUTER JOIN T2
  PARTITION BY (COL) ON T1.COL1=T2.COL2
 GROUP BY
```
